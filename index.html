                Hello!
                In case you didn't know, my name is Sara Maneval. I was born in Pennsylvania but raised in Montana. When it came time to decide on what career I should strive for I knew right away I wanted to work for Disney. I love computers and Disney so Computer Animation seemed like the ideal degree for me.  It took a couple of colleges to find the right one but, after I found Full Sail University, I knew it was the best decision for me. I was taught the whole pipeline in less than 2 years. I graduated on September 28,2012 with a Bachelors in Computer Animation. My longterm goal is to work at Disney Pixar as a Senior Lighting Artist. As of right now I am a 3D Interior Designer at Medialab 3D Solutions. I am also graduating in November 2016 with my second Bachelors in Web Design and Development!
                Please feel free to contact me!
                Cheers!
                Sara Maneval
